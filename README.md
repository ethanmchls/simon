# simon-html

After having worked on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all in conjunction, it's kind of hard to go back and do one at a time. I feel like I've been in the habit of doing HTML and CSS at the same time and tweaking them until they look the way I want. But this is helping me learn to treat HTML as more of a skeleton and work on building the skeleton separate from the muscle and skin per se. But it's been a good exercise for that reason.
